            Hello, I am Dhawal, a tech-savvy problem solver who approaches
            challenges with an insatiable hunger for knowledge.
            <br />
            <br />
            My approach to problem-solving involves delving deeply into the
            intricacies of the issue at hand, ensuring that I am equipped with
            the tools and expertise needed to devise a successful solution.
            <br />
            <br />
            One aspect of my work that I take immense pride in is my attention
            to detail. Every line of code that I write is imbued with a level of
            watchfulness that ensures optimal functionality and performance.
            <br />
            <br />
            While I may be relatively new to the industry, I have already
            achieved significant recognition for my problem-solving skills.
            <br />
            <br />
            I have been awarded a 5 ‚≠ê Gold Badge from HackerRank, attesting to
            my prowess in tackling complex coding challenges.
            <br />
            <br />
            So, if you're seeking a knowledgeable, detail-oriented, and
